I was born and raised in southern Brazil.
My work life started roughly when Myspace became popular - if I recall correctly between 2007 and 2009. Myspace allowed users to customize their profiles and create all sorts of interesting web designs, what I believe to be one of the biggest reasons for its popularity. This, aligned with my interest in music, led me to work as web designer for musician friends and acquaintances.

I loved it. I liked the visual exploration needed to achieve a unique web design, and then having to figure out how to translate those designs into code, specifically for that platform. That involved a decent amount of hacking (table layouts, anyone? javascript hover states with image replacement?), which was challenging but ended up being formative to where I am today.

Fast forward a few years and I'm not as involved with web design, but I ended up discovering that front-end is what the code that I like to write the most is called. Code that delivers interactivity, content, and ultimately awesome experiences to customers.

Nowadays I help businessess achieve results via technology - as little of it as possible. I'm pretty flexible with that statement as it always depends on context: how big the business is, how old it is, how large the team is, how much time do we have.

I'm also flexible when it comes to technical preferences: I do like my front-end, but I don't shy away from work that involves infrastructure, back-ends, databases or CI/CD pipelines, and I'm not married to any one programming language or framework.

Strong communication, empathy and speed are some of the things I try to focus on and make my specialties.
