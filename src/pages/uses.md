## Software

- IDE: VS Code
  - Theme: Solarized Light
  - Font: Whatever is default on Mac??? Monaco?
- Terminal: zsh (+ oh-my-zsh) running inside VS Code
- Browser: Firefox as the daily driver, Safari for work.
  - Extensions: OneTab, uBlock Origin, Privacy Badger, OctoLinker, SteamDB
- Database management: TablePlus
- VCS: I used Sourcetree for a good part of a decade due to its great branch visualization. Switched to a VS Code extension called Git Graph that accomplishes the same thing but doesn't require me to switch apps. For other version control needs, VS Code's UI and the terminal suffice.
- [Namecheap](https://www.namecheap.com/) is my preferred domain registrar.

### Other software

- Communications: Slack
- Window management: [Rectangle](https://rectangleapp.com/), spiritual successor of Spectacle. You need this if you're coming from Windows.
- Task management: A trusty todo.txt file most of the time, especially for work. Apple Reminders for timed tasks (and groceries). Notion for more complex planning.
- Music: Spotify
- ImageOptim for the occasional image optimization need.
- SoundID Reference to calibrate my headphones.

## Hardware
