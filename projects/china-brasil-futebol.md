China Brasil Futebol is a website that aims to deliver news and up-to-date information about the chinese soccer scene -  and brazilians playing there - to brazilian fans.

## Role
I was the lead back-end developer on this project. I used Ruby on Rails and MySQL for the tech stack, and the website was deployed to a DigitalOcean droplet. During the project, there were times when I'd have to make small adjustments on the front-end as well but I stayed most on the management and business rule domains.

## Technologies involved

* Ruby
* Ruby on Rails
* MySQL
* [Rails admin](https://github.com/sferik/rails_admin)

## Key takeaways
This was the first production-grade project I developed using Ruby on Rails. I felt very productive, but I feel that that's at the expense of seeing some magic going on sometimes.
