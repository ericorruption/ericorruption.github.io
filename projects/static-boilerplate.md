title: Static Boilerplate

This is my testing grounds for new libraries, naming methodologies, organization patterns, anything that has to do with front-end.

This is a starting repository with some front-end tooling preconfigured to start working on static projects (like landing pages, prototypes and one-off static websites).

## Role

I'm the sole maintainer of the project (PRs welcome!), and have been since 2014, when I first launched it.

## Technologies involved

- HTML
- Sass
- Javascript (ES6)

## Key takeaways

Having to decide tooling on every project is pointless. It's far more productive
to have something you and your team can trust on that is full of good practices,
scales and extends just fine.
