title: claimsforce

claimsforce (yes, lowercase) is a startup in the insurance sector. They aim to improve the claim handling experience for all parties involved - insured, insurers, and everyone in between. To do that, they offer different products. To name a few, they offer a mobile app for claim experts, a back office system for insurances and third party adjusters and a disposition engine to find the best expert to deal with an insurance claim.

## Role

Officially, front-end developer. On the day-to-day efforts, pretty much anything goes. Dealing with back-end and mobile development, devOps, designing and prototyping aren't uncommon.

## Technologies involved

- Typescript
- React
- GraphQL
- Auth0
- AWS (Lambda / Codepipeline / DynamoDB / Cloudformation / S3 / etc)

## Key takeaways

This was the first time I worked on a multidisciplinary product team. Even though agile methodologies might be a part of the daily routines of other organizational structures, this was the first time I saw and participated into changing and shaping these habits based on the team evolution.

Furthermore, the feedback and development cycles are much shorter compared to specialty teams (e.g.: front-end team, mobile team).
