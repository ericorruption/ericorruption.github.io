HAPPYCAR is a rental car comparison startup. Their mission is to provide the best
rental car offer for their customers.

## Role

At HAPPYCAR I wore many hats and worked on many different parts of their product.

- I worked on improving the loading performance of key marketing pages - by reducing the amount of requests, file sizes, optimizing images, serving them as static files, simplifying and refactoring code.
- Redesigned the marketing pages to have a modern look - especially taking us ahead of the competition.
- Created together with the whole team a [brand guide](https://brand.happycar.de/) - in order to enforce correct usage of the brand.
- Published a [UI pattern library](https://happycar.github.io/happycar-ui/) - to create consistency across the different ongoing projects.
- We did lots of A/B testing in features before they rolled out - in order to confirm they were valuable for our customers AND for the business.

Among other things.

## Technologies involved

- HTML, CSS &amp; JavaScript
- React
- React Native
- Node.js
- AWS

## Key takeaways

At HAPPYCAR, the teams continuously fail fast and learn fast.

Some of our efforts had long standing benefits. The marketing pages, for example, at the time, had a pagespeed score of 100 on mobile devices. SEO has always been crucial for
product success and improving performance helped the pages stay relevant in this aspect.

Improving how we communicate with our customer is another product pillar that we've worked towards. This even led me to become better at communicating with the team.
