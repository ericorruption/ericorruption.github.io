Piccadilly is one of the 5 biggest shoe brands in Brazil. This is their multi-language corporate website and blog.
The website is also used to spread the word about new product collections.

## Role

Me and one other front-dev worked on the views and interactions while another developer worked on the back-end, using Laravel as a foundation for the project.

I was also responsible for reaching a common ground regarding the differences between desktop and mobile views, coming up with a mix of both on screens that didn't fall in either of those categories. This is what led the project to be fully, fluidly responsive.

## Technologies involved

- Gulp
- HTML
- Sass
- Javascript (jQuery)
- Browserify
- Browsersync
- PHP
- Laravel
- Wordpress
- Google Maps API

## Key takeaways

This was the first large-scale project that we used namespaces for our CSS classes, along with the BEM naming convention. It worked quite well and the team adopted the changes for subsequent projects.

The blog management was developed using Wordpress. Laravel lives alongside Wordpress and I think that's extremely satisfying because you have a very good tool for blog management that would take way longer to perfect inside Laravel.
