Velocitygrowth is a startup based in Solano Beach, CA, that offers custom chatbot development services and has their own product: **Vinny G**, a multitasking chatbot.

## Role
On this project, my role was redesigning and coding the front-end of their corporate website. For that, I used a mobile-first, responsive approach and designed most of the website directly in the browser using front-end technologies.

The project also has a very barebones page management system, that reads markdown files and spits them as html files, available at user-friendly urls.

## Technologies involved

* Gulp
* HTML
* Sass
* Javascript (ES6)
* Markdown

This project is deployed to Heroku, with Codeship as the continuous delivery middleware. The project runs tests automatically on each local commit using [pre-commit](http://pre-commit.com/).


## Key takeaways
Designing on the browser is a very good technique. It usually takes longer to achieve the same thing on graphics software, but there's no separate coding stage.
