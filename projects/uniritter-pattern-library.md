title: Uniritter Pattern Library
website: http://uniritter.surge.sh
---

This is my design degree's final project: a front-end components library based on Twitter Bootstrap.

## Role
I designed a responsive pattern library using Bootstrap as a base, adding components I saw fit and removing those I thought would have no use for a university website design system on the long run.

I coded the changes and they're open source, so [the project is available here](https://github.com/ericorruption/uniritter-pattern-library).

## Technologies involved

* Gulp
* HTML
* Less
* Javascript (jQuery)
* Bootstrap

The project is deployed to [surge](https://surge.sh), a very easy to use static site hosting.

## Key takeaways
Uniritter's official website used some of the ideas in my project for their latest redesign!
