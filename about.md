title: About me

I was born and raised in southern Brazil. I always strive to improve myself - keeping up with technology advancements, testing out new libraries, attending conferences, you name it.

I have some experience with back-end technologies but I feel I'm better at the front-end.<br/>
I can actually **see** what my code changed &mdash; and the reward of seeing people interact with something you built is simply priceless.

I always try to keep all possible aspects of an applications front-end in check: accessibility, performance, modularity, scalability and overall user experience. This also demands testing on several use case conditions &mdash; such as screen sizes, input devices, battery, internet connection.<br/>
Because of that, I usually rely on a mobile-first, responsive approach, in which we begin with an accessible, performant experience, and build on top of that taking into account each device's capabilities.

My education is in graphic arts, but the browser has always felt like a great canvas to me as well.<br/>

Above all, I believe that delightful experiences to the target user make all the difference.
