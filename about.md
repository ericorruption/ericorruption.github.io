title: About me

---

I'm southern Brazil born and raised. I work on the web since 2010,
and I always strive to improve myself - keeping up with technology advancements, testing out new libraries, you name it.

I have a bit of experience with back-end technologies but I feel I'm better at the front-end.<br/>
I can actually **see** what my code changed &mdash; and the reward of interacting with something you built is simply priceless.

I always try to keep all possible aspects of an applications front-end in check: accessibility, performance, modularity, scalability and overall user experience. That also demands testing on several use case conditions &mdash; such as screen sizes, input devices, battery, internet connection.<br/>
Because of that, I usually rely on a mobile-first, responsive approach, where we have an accessible, performant experience, and increment that based on a device's capabilities.

My education is in graphic arts, but the browser has always felt like a great canvas to me as well.<br/>
As a designer, I can deliver interface wireframes, prototypes, layouts and brand identity assets.

Above all, I believe that delightful experiences to the target user make all the difference.
